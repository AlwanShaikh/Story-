<h1><u></b>
Chapter 1 :  Forgetting everything
</b></u></h1>
<p>
So the story starts with a beautiful morning of December. Everything was covered in the snow. And then our beloved Wasuke woke up by forgetting his name what had happened yesterday. Then he saw a notification popping up on his smartphone, it was a text saying "Good Morning" He was confused by seeing the text, he replied "who are you?". And then the girl replies "Check your note dumbo". And then he sees his note , it was written.' My name is Wasuke and Nozomi is my love and soon we're going to get married. I have a rare condition called amnesia in which I forgets everything what has happened yesterday'. Then after seeing the note he text "Okay I see" . Nozomi text him "Wanna check out the cafe, they have something new in their menu". He replies " Sure ig". And they spent their whole day enjoying. Another day starts with no memories of yesterday then a text appears on his smartphone saying "Good Morning Wasuke" Once again he was confused and replied with " Who are you and how do you know my name". And the other person replies " Check your notes you idiot". In the notes it was written 'Yesterday I enjoyed my whole day spending time with Nozomi we visited our favorite cafe 'Sakura Kōhī ' and roamed around the street all day". Then Wasuke replies to Nozomi "So you are the one whom I love". Nozomi replied "Yes I'm, now tell me where you wanna go today? ".Wasuke replied " Let's go and watch fireworks today". Nozomi replied "sure let's go". As the sun setted, they sit close to each other looking at the beautiful fireworks. At that time Wasuke  said to Nozomi "I wish this day would never end and just keep going on in a loop. I don't want to forget you anymore I love you so much(with tears flowing from his eyes)".Nozomi calmed him down and said "We can't do anything everything is God's plan, I guess God has planned something good for us afterwards that's why we are facing problems at this time, but don't worry I'll always make you remember who you are". And they both enjoyed the fireworks. The other day Wasuke again wakes up with no memory of yesterday once again a text came from Nozomi " Good Morning" . As expected he was again confused and replied "who? ". She said check ur notes, after reading everything he remembers himself. Then he replied (with tears in his eyes) "Why don't you leave me? Even though I have became a problem for you, everyday you have to make me remember who I am. And even if u leave me I will forget you next because of my condition". Nozomi replies "This is the only thing called love, I'll make u remember everything about me everyday even if u forget me and I'll never leave you because I truly love you, and don't u dare to say such things again". Wasuke replied " Okay I'll never tell that again". Then they plans to go to beach and see sunset. And the time of returning Wasuke said "I love you Nozomi and please always be happy" . Nozomi was confused that why is he telling me like that? And then they went to each other's house and the next morning Wasuke woke up and again a text came saying "Good morning". Wasuke was confused he replies "who? ".Then Nozomi said " Go check ur notes" . Then Wasuke saw the notes, it was written " My name is Wasuke" and on the other line it was written "move on". Then Wasuke replies " The note just tell that 'I am Wasuke' and 'move on' ". Nozomi replies " What are you telling, why did you do this, why did you deleted all things, I am your love, scroll up and see all the chats" . Wasuke replied " There's nothing above the good morning message you sent me, I don't know you I am blocking you " Then he blocks her......

After Wasuke blocked Nozomi. She immediately rushed towards his house. His house was like 5 mins walk away from her. After 5 mins of walk she reached his house. She knocked at the door*knock knock*. A confusing voice came from inside "Who's There". Nozomi replied "it's me my love". Wasuke replied "who? , and why r u telling me ur love? ". Nozomi replied "I'll explain everything just let me in".Wasuke replied " Okay! ".*Door Opens* "Hello! There" Nozomi said, and then enters the house. She explained everything to him but he was not believing her. Then Nozomi shows him all the photos of them. Then he understands everything. Wasuke said "So you are my gf? I see, but in my notes why it is written that move on". Nozomi replied "I dunno". Suddenly it started to rain outside, they decided to go and have fun in it. They get ready and left the house. They were so happy enjoying the rain and both were dancing in the puddles like they were kids. At that time Wasuke said to Nozomi "I'm in love with you so hard that I just don't wanna leave you, I wanna spend every moment of my life with you, soon we'll get married, once I finished my study and get a job, so please stay with me till then. And the day ends. Things were going well until it again happened, the 'move on' thing. But this time Nozomi gets sus that something's fishy here. Nozomi thinks to go through his phone. after looking in his phone she found something unusual, a text from an unknown number saying "You deserve better. Let him go". Nozomi was shocked after seeing it. Now she has decided to find who's after this all shit. The other day they have an appointment of their doctor. The day passed and they went to the doctor. The doctor reveals that Wasuke’s amnesia is getting worse day by day and soon will become irreversible. And doctor also reveals that sometimes Wasuke  will suddenly start remembering some old fragments of life, it can either be sad or happy. After the appointment they spend their whole day at the park talking to each other. As the time passes Nozomi started recording videos to help Wasuke remember things fast. One day Wasuke wakes up and replies to Nozomi's text without checking notes. They thought that the condition is approving. But one day something unexhappen happens, Wasuke finds a note saying "Nozomi is lying to you". He tolds her about the note but she replied that she swear she has never lied to him. ‌As Wasuke starts remembering fragments of the past, he realizes there’s a memory that Nozomi never told him about a secret she has kept hidden.
